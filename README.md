## A study on emotives

The _Emotives Project_ is a set of tools, which allow you to build your own real-time emotion recognizer based on acoustic properties of speech (not using word information).

## Platform

Python

## Installation

With [Visual Studio 2015 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52685), run `install.cmd` to download core binaries and install an embedded version of Python.

If you plan to extract SoundNet features, you will also have to execute `install_tensorflow.cmd` and download the file [sound8.npy](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B9wE6h4m--wjR015M1RLZW45OEU) into the `chains` folder.
